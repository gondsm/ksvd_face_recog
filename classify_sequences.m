% Classify Sequences
% Author: Gon√ßalo S. Martins
% This script takes a number of pre-clustered image sequences and builds
% the appropriate dictionaries, using the K-SVD toolbox <link goes here>.
% This script assumes the following folder structure:
%
% <sequences_root>/seq_<something>/1
%                 ^               /2
%                 |               /
%                 One per seq.    ^
%                                 | One per cluster (names should be 1, 2,
%                                                    etc.)

% For now, this needs to stay; we're not cleaning up properly at the end
clear all

% Load image clusters
% For now, filenames are hard-coded (and the above structure is not
% actually used or needed
